            by a circle determined by coordinates (latitude and longitude) and a radius.
            by a simple polygon delimited by segments connecting consecutively  an array of coordinates (points). The last point connects to the first  point to delimit a closed shape bounded with straight sides.
            The retrieved shape depends on the network conditions at the device's location and any of the supported shapes could be received.
            The requester could optionally ask for a freshness of the localization information by providing a maxAge ("I want a location not older than 600 seconds").
            The result accuracy depends on the network's ability and accuracy to locate the device.
            Additionally to location information, the answer will also provide indication about the location time.
            Location retrieval API could be useful in scenarios such as:
            Fraud protection to ensure a given user is located in the region, country or location authorized for financial transactions
            Verify the GPS coordinates reported by the app on a device to  ensure the GPS was not faked e.g. for content delivery with regional  restrictions
            Contextual-based advertising, to trigger advertising after verifying the device is in the area of interest
            Smart Mobility (Vehicle/bikes renting): obtain the location of a vehicle/bike to guarantee they are rented correctly
            Note: Location is in most jurisdictions considered  to be sensitive data and thereby consent by device owner/user must be  verified before providing it to the developer.`

            title: "Identifying a device from the access token",
            content: `This specification defines the device object field as  optional in API requests, specifically in cases where the API is  accessed using a 3-legged access token, and the device can be uniquely  identified by the token. This approach simplifies API usage for API  consumers by relying on the device information associated with the  access token used to invoke the API.
            Handling of device information:
            Optional device object for 3-legged tokens:
            When using a 3-legged access token, the device associated with the  access token must be considered as the device for the API request. This  means that the device object is not required in the request, and if  included it must identify the same device, therefore it is recommended NOT to include it in these scenarios to simplify the API usage and avoid additional validations.
            Validation mechanism:
            The server will extract the device identification from the access token, if available.
            If the API request additionally includes a device  object when using a 3-legged access token, the API will validate that  the device identifier provided matches the one associated with the  access token.
            If there is a mismatch, the API will respond with a 403 -  INVALID_TOKEN_CONTEXT error, indicating that the device information in  the request does not match the token.
            Error handling for unidentifiable devices:
            If the device object is not included in the request and the device information cannot be derived from the 3-legged access  token, the server will return a 422 UNIDENTIFIABLE_DEVICE error.
            Restrictions for tokens without an associated authenticated identifier:
            For scenarios which do not have a single device identifier  associated to the token during the authentication flow, e.g. 2-legged  access tokens, the device object MUST be provided in the  API request. This ensures that the device identification is explicit and valid for each API call made with these tokens.`
